Sign in with [NEAR] and add a message to the guest book! A starter app built with an [AssemblyScript] backend and a [React] frontend.


Quick Start
===========

To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you have Node.js ≥ 12 installed (https://nodejs.org), then use it to install [yarn]: `npm install --global yarn` (or just `npm i -g yarn`)
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install` (or just `yarn`)
3. Run the local development server: `yarn dev` (see `package.json` for a
   full list of `scripts` you can run with `yarn`)

Now you'll have a local development environment backed by the NEAR TestNet! Running `yarn dev` will tell you the URL you can visit in your browser to see the app.


Exploring The Code
==================

1. The backend code lives in the `/assembly` folder. This code gets deployed to
   the NEAR blockchain when you run `yarn deploy:contract`. This sort of
   code-that-runs-on-a-blockchain is called a "smart contract" – [learn more
   about NEAR smart contracts][smart contract docs].
2. The frontend code lives in the `/src` folder.
   [/src/index.html](/src/index.html) is a great place to start exploring. Note
   that it loads in `/src/index.js`, where you can learn how the frontend
   connects to the NEAR blockchain.
3. Tests: there are different kinds of tests for the frontend and backend. The
   backend code gets tested with the [asp] command for running the backend
   AssemblyScript tests, and [jest] for running frontend tests. You can run
   both of these at once with `yarn test`.

Both contract and client-side code will auto-reload as you change source files.


Deploy
======

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][NEAR accounts]. When you run `yarn dev`, your smart contracts get deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a throwaway account. When you're ready to make it permanent, here's how.


Step 0: Install near-shell
--------------------------

You need near-shell installed globally. Here's how:

    npm install --global near-shell

This will give you the `near` [CLI] tool. Ensure that it's installed with:

    near --version


Step 1: Create an account for the contract
------------------------------------------

Visit [NEAR Wallet] and make a new account. You'll be deploying these smart contracts to this new account.

Now authorize NEAR shell for this new account, and follow the instructions it gives you:

    near login


Step 2: set contract name in code
---------------------------------

Modify the line in `src/config.js` that sets the account name of the contract. Set it to the account id you used above.

    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'your-account-here!'


Step 3: deploy!
---------------

One command:

    yarn deploy

As you can see in `package.json`, this does two things:

1. builds & deploys smart contracts to NEAR TestNet
2. builds & deploys frontend code to GitHub using [gh-pages]. This will only work if the project already has a repository set up on GitHub. Feel free to modify the `deploy` script in `package.json` to deploy elsewhere.
